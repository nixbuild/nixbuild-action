v23

## Changes

* Add support for pointing `nixbuild-action` to a self-hosted nixbuild.net
  deployment.

* Make it possible to set any nixbuild.net settings through the new `settings`
  input. This also removes the inputs `caches`, `reuse-build-failures` and
  `reuse-build-timeouts`, which can be set through the new general `settings`
  input instead.

* Make it possible to attach tags to your builds through the new `tags` input.
  The tags can later be used in the nixbuild.net HTTP API to find specific
  builds.
